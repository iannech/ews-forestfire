# ews-forestfire
The aim of this project is to create an early warning and emergency response system for the rampant forest wildfires around the globe, that threatens wildlife and human life. 
This system will make use of IoT technology to sense and detect fires, realtime drone technology to map the fires and behind the scenes, predictive analytics to map the impact of the fire thus triggering the appropriate warning alarms to the population.
